*Importance of the project*

Introducing the Django project I built during my bootcamp üöÄ. I'm thrilled to share this hands-on experience where I delved into the world of web development and created a dynamic platform that's both engaging and user-friendly. The project features database-driven components that require user login and authentication for access, making it a secure and personalized space for meat enthusiasts.

üßë‚ÄçüíªHere's what you can explore on the Cold Meats Website:
[1]Catalogue: Dive into a mouthwatering assortment of cold meats, all neatly categorised and easily accessible once you log in.
[2] Blog: Stay updated with the latest meaty news, recipes, and industry insights in our blog section.
[3] Polls: Cast your votes and see what fellow meat aficionados have to say about your favorite cuts and flavours.
